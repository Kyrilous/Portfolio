                Hi, Iâ€™m Kyrilous Nasr, a Computer Science major at CUNY Queens College. I recently interned at Ubiq, a spatial media startup, where I built features in Swift/SwiftUI 
                and worked with the team to test and refine the product. The experience gave me a real look at startup development and taught me how to adapt quickly, solve problems with a team, 
                and see how code directly impacts users. I also work as a substitute paraprofessional for the NYC Department of Education. <br></br> Outside of school and work, I enjoy coding side projects, cars, and gaming.
