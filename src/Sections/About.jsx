                <p> 
                    Hi, I'm Kyrilous Nasr, a Computer Science major at CUNY Queens College. I recently interned at Ubiq, a spatial media startup, where I built features in Swift/SwiftUI
                    and worked with the team to test and refine the product. The experience gave me a real look at startup development and taught me how to adapt quickly, solve problems with a team,
                    and see how code directly impacts users. I also work as a substitute paraprofessional for the NYC Department of Education. <br></br> Outside of school and work, I enjoy coding side projects, cars, and gaming.

                    I interned at Ubiq, a spatial media startup, where I build featrures in Swift/SwiftUI and worked with the teams to test and refine the final product.
                    The role gave me a chance to improce my technical skills, adapt quickly, and see how the things I build directly shaped the user experience.
